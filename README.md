# whatsapi

WhatsApi allows you to use a whatapp api in a local way by using whatapp web with pywhakit which controls the interface to execute whatsapp actions.

Using this is a high risk of violating whatsapp rules and policies so it should be used sparingly and it is recommended to use phone numbers you are willing to lose.
